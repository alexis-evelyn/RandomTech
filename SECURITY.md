# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As we are only in alpha builds and not a full release yet, only the latest version is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you see a security vulnerability, send me a message at Alexis.Evelyn#7572 on Discord. Do NOT post it as an issue. You can send in a PR with the fix to the security issue if you want.

You can expect an update on the vulnerability report when it is fixed. I'll also send a reply on if the vulnerability was already reported or a thanks for reporting when you send the report to me.

After the vulnerability is patched, an announcement will be made on the Discord #releases channel to drop the vulnerable versions. An issue will also be created to have the vulnerability posted in the changelogs.

If you know of a free service for managing vulnerability reports, please let me know.
