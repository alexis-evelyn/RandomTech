## Checklist:

- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines of this project (To Be Determined. Try to Follow Bouncer Pattern For Now)
- [ ] My code keeps bracketless single If/Else statements where reasonable
- [ ] My code uses annotations where reasonable ([4.](#reference-markers) e.g. @NotNull where returns are never null and in method arguments where null is unexpected)
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation
- [ ] If this is a translation update, check this box to signal that you would not/could not use Crowdin ([5.](#reference-markers) e.g. if you needed to update the code for a translation to work properly)

## Reference Markers:

1. The issue should be referenced in a way the Github can autolink it (e.g. #1). If the issue does not exist yet, create it and reference it. This is important because the auto-changelog generate uses issues and PRs to generate the changelog.
2. The Github Pages /docs/ does not count as code for this purpose, so it falls under here.
3. Translation necessary changes refers to parameters in code such as TranslatableText.
Basically, the parameters in code would not work with the translation for that locale without changes to the code.
Please update the English/US translation files if applicable. Crowdin's setup to import the English/US files for translation.
4. Use Jetbrain's annotations over JavaX. The PR will be modified/denied unless the annotation cannot be performed with Jetbrains (and can be performed with JavaX).
5. If this is just a simple translation which doesn't modify code, then submit the translation through [Crowdin][crowdin-link] instead.
